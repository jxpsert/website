    <h1>Hi there.</h1><br>
    <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>I'm Jasper, I'm 15 years old and I'm from the Netherlands.<br>I currently follow HAVO education at a high school in Nijmegen.</p>
        <p>I'm a starting developer, and am able to use a multitude of programming languages, like JavaScript, PHP, C# and a bit of Python. I'm also proficient in web languages, like HTML and CSS.</p>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>I've made multiple projects using my skills, both in school assignments and personal use.
            <br>Here's some of my top ones.</p>
        <h5>&bull; Kristalbank</h5>
        <p class="languages">JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP</p>
        <p>Kristalbank was one of my personal projects. Yes, it was made for my school, but it wasn't an assignment. The plan was to actually deploy this in my school, however, I couldn't find the time.</p>
            <p>As the name suggests, Kristalbank is a bank. The name is derived from my school's name. In this bank, people don't have euros, dollars, pounds or whatever - they have crystals.
            <br>The general idea was that students could earn crystals by getting high grades, a higher grade meaning getting more crystals. With this, they could buy online stuff, like videogames, or resources in those games.
            <br>The plan was ambitious, and I didn't realise at the time how huge the costs of this would be. The project remains on my server, as a reminder of bad ideas.</p>

        <br><br>
        <h5>&bull; BoekSelector</h5>
        <p class="languages">JavaScript, HTML</p>
        <p>This, I actually use on a daily basis.</p>
            <p>BoekSelector shows me what books I should pack for the day, based on a daily schedule. The schedule is consistent every week, so it requires no outside connection.
            <br>It gets the difference between 2 arrays - classes today, and classes the day before. It then says which books should be taken out, and which should go in, along with a simple overview of today's classes.
            <br>I made this in one morning using JavaScript.</p>
